                    I build platforms and lead the teams behind them. My path took me from 
                    founding engineer to engineering manager to product leader — each phase 
                    building on the last. Currently at <span class="highlight">Spotify</span>.

                    I believe the best platform leaders understand the code, not just the roadmap. 
                    That's why I still build — shipping AI products to stay sharp.

                <h2 class="section-title">The Journey</h2>
                <div class="about-grid">

                        <p class="lead">
                            I didn't start as a manager or a product person. I started as an engineer 
                            who couldn't stop asking "why are we building this?"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At 23, I moved from Cairo to Germany to pursue a Master's in Computer Science. 
                            I joined startups where there was no PM — so I became one by necessity. 
                            I designed UX, built iOS apps, shipped products, and learned that 
                            <strong>ownership isn't a title</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Delivery Hero, I grew from senior engineer to domain lead, 
                            managing 18 engineers across 3 squads. At Spotify, I led platform teams 
                            and eventually transitioned to product leadership — not as a pivot, 
                            but as a natural evolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today I blend product strategy with engineering depth. I define roadmaps, 
                            but I can also read the PR. I set metrics, but I understand the systems 
                            that produce them.

                        <h3>Clarity Over Comfort</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hard conversations are a kindness. Ambiguity is cruel. 
                            Whether it's feedback to a team member or pushback to leadership, 
                            I prioritize clarity — even when it's uncomfortable.

                        <h3>Context Over Control</h3>
                        <p>
                            I don't tell people what to do. I tell them why it matters and 
                            let them figure out how. The best solutions come from people 
                            closest to the problem.

                        <h3>Build the Builders</h3>
                        <p>
                            My job isn't to be the best engineer or PM. It's to make everyone 
                            around me better. I've mentored engineers to senior, EMs to domain leads. 
                            That's the legacy that matters.

                        <h3>Influence Over Authority</h3>
                        <p>
                            Authority gets compliance. Influence gets commitment. 
                            The best leaders rarely need to pull rank because people 
                            want to follow them.

                                Full-stack across backend, iOS, and web. Led major migrations: 
                                PHP → Go, Objective-C → Swift, Backbone → React. 
                                Learned what it means to build at scale.

                                Built products from scratch with no PM. Owned everything: 
                                user research, UX design, branding, engineering. 
                                This is where I learned that product ownership is a mindset, not a title.
